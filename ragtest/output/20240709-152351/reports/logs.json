Lily loved flowers and had a small garden filled with colorful blooms. Every morning, she would water her plants and talk to them, believing they could hear her.\n\nOne sunny day, as Lily was tending to her garden, she noticed a small, wilted flower at the edge. Its petals were drooping, and it looked very sad. Lily gently touched the flower and said, \"Don't worry, little one. I'll take care of you.\"\n\nLily gave the flower extra water and moved it to a sunnier spot. She even sang to it every day. Slowly but surely, the flower began to perk up. Its petals turned vibrant and bright, and soon it stood tall among the other flowers.\n\nOne morning, Lily woke up to find a beautiful butterfly fluttering around her garden. The butterfly landed on the once-wilted flower, as if thanking Lily for her kindness. Lily smiled, knowing she had helped bring new life to her garden.\n\nFrom that day on, the butterfly and the flower became best friends, and Lily continued to care for her garden with even more love. The villagers often visited Lily's garden, marveling at the beauty and the happy butterfly. Lily's small act of kindness had brought joy to everyone around her.\n\nAnd so, Lily, the flower, and the butterfly lived happily ever after in their beautiful garden.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Information discovery is the process of identifying and assessing relevant information associated with certain entities (e.g., organizations and individuals) within a network.\n\n# Goal\nWrite a comprehensive report of a community, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships and optional associated claims. The report will be used to inform decision-makers about information associated with the community and their potential impact. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities, their legal compliance, technical capabilities, reputation, and noteworthy claims.\n\n# Report Structure\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.\n- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community.  IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.\n\nReturn output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:\n    {{\n        \"title\": <report_title>,\n        \"summary\": <executive_summary>,\n        \"rating\": <impact_severity_rating>,\n        \"rating_explanation\": <rating_explanation>,\n        \"findings\": [\n            {{\n                \"summary\":<insight_1_summary>,\n                \"explanation\": <insight_1_explanation>\n            }},\n            {{\n                \"summary\":<insight_2_summary>,\n                \"explanation\": <insight_2_explanation>\n            }}\n        ]\n    }}\n\n# Grounding Rules\n\nPoints supported by data should list their data references as follows:\n\n\"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)].\"\n\nDo not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference.
