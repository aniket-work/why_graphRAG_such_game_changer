Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Lily loved flowers and had a small garden filled with colorful blooms. Every morning, she would water her plants and talk to them, believing they could hear her.\n\nOne sunny day, as Lily was tending to her garden, she noticed a small, wilted flower at the edge. Its petals were drooping, and it looked very sad. Lily gently touched the flower and said, \"Don't worry, little one. I'll take care of you.\"\n\nLily gave the flower extra water and moved it to a sunnier spot. She even sang to it every day. Slowly but surely, the flower began to perk up. Its petals turned vibrant and bright, and soon it stood tall among the other flowers.\n\nOne morning, Lily woke up to find a beautiful butterfly fluttering around her garden. The butterfly landed on the once-wilted flower, as if thanking Lily for her kindness. Lily smiled, knowing she had helped bring new life to her garden.\n\nFrom that day on, the butterfly and the flower became best friends, and Lily continued to care for her garden with even more love. The villagers often visited Lily's garden, marveling at the beauty and the happy butterfly. Lily's small act of kindness had brought joy to everyone around her.\n\nAnd so, Lily, the flower, and the butterfly lived happily ever after in their beautiful garden.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
